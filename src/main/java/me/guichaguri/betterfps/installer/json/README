JSON is a light-weight, language independent, data interchange format.
See http://www.JSON.org/

The files in this package implement JSON encoders/decoders in Java.

This is a reference implementation. There is a large number of JSON packages
in Java. Perhaps someday the Java community will standardize on one. Until
then, choose carefully.

The license includes this restriction: "The software shall be used for good,
not evil." If your conscience cannot live with that, then choose a different
package.

This package was changed by Guilherme Chaguri in order to minify it, removing
useless files for this project. All of the code for this library was made by
Douglas Crockford.
